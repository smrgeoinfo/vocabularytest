# Configure action for processing vocabularies
# Setup for this action is defined in action.yml
# This can be run locally using act (https://github.com/nektos/act) like this:
# act -v -j build --
# This defines the workflow steps, most critically the values for the 
#   that will be passed to the Docker Container for use by the python code
#   inside the container. 
# Print and echo statments will appear in the workflow log in github when the 
#   action is executed.

# INSTRUCTIONS
# --the build/steps/uses value should be the name of your vocabulary repository. 
#       The @ value in this string specifies the branch that will be used.
# -- specify the action command in build/steps/with/action. 'docs' will generate 
#       markdown and HTML;  'uijson' will generate JSON 
# -- you shouldn't need to change build/steps/with/path
# -- build/steps/with/inputttl is a single string that is a pipe-delimited list of the 
#       SKOS vocabulary files in the /vocabulary directory that should be processed. 
#       leave off the file extensions. NOTE that the files will be assumed to be 
#       serialized using the Turtle format. Do not enclose the string in quotes, and have no spaces #       in the string
# -- build/steps/with/inputvocaburi is a single string that is a pipe-delimited list of the 
#       skos:ConceptScheme URIs in each vocabulary file. The order of the URIS must match 
#       the order of the file names. It will be assumed that each file contains only one 
#       ConceptScheme.Do not enclose the string in quotes, and have no spaces in the string.
