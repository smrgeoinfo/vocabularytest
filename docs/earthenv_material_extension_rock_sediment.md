# **Concept scheme:** iSamples rock and sediment vocabulary extension

Vocabulary last modified:  2023-08-27

subtitle: 
  Kinds of rock material.
  Rock and sediment categories for iSamples materialType classification. Remove anthropogenic materials and classes for consolidated or non-consolidated material; remove leaf classes subjectively based on abundance of material type and number of subclasses. There are 83 'mat:rock' subclasses; these include some classes that are non-consolidated material (e.g. fault gouge) but these are not sediment and adding 'material' classes that are independent of consolidation seems like more overhead than needed. Note that a given material is likely to fit in more that one class; for example the sediment subclasses include compositional classes (e.g. carbonate, clastic) as well as grain size classes (gravel-size sediment). A calcareous ooze sample would be both 'mud-size sediment' and 'carbonate sediment'.   Change owl:class to skos:concept, and rdfs:subClassOf to skos:broader.

[]{#breccia}

###  `https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Breccia`

- Child of:
 [`rock`](#rock)

- Coarse-grained material composed of angular broken rock fragments;
the fragments typically have sharp edges and unworn corners. The
fragments may be held together by a mineral cement or in a fine-
grained matrix, and consolidated or nonconsolidated. Clasts may be of
any composition or origin. In sedimentary environments, breccia is
used for material that consists entirely of angular fragments, mostly
derived from a single source rock body, as in a rock avalanche
deposit, and matrix is interpreted to be the product of comminution of
clasts during transport. Diamictite or diamicton is used when the
material reflects mixing of rock from a variety of sources, some sub
angular or subrounded clasts may be present, and matrix is pre-
existing fine grained material that is not a direct product of the
brecciation/deposition process.

- Note that technical definition, based on modal mineralogy plotted in
a QAPF triangle may be applied qualitatively, based on phenocryst
mineralogy when ground mass mineralogy can not be determined
optically, or based on CIPW norm. Although TAS categories are defined
based on chemical analyses, the correspondence with the QAPF defined
categories is generally close enough that QAPF categories are commonly
used interchangeably with TAS categories. It is important to note the
basis for assignment of fine-grained igneous rocks to a specifice
lithology category.

with minor plagioclase and biotite, in a microcrystalline,
cryptocrystalline or glassy groundmass. Flow texture is common.

hornblende and/or biotite. Fine grained equivalent of dioritic rock.

recommended in this system. If chemical analytical data are available
to constrain the silica content, the basalt or andesite category
should be used.

- Robertson (1999, Classification of metamorphic rocks: British
Geological Survey Research Report, RR 99–02) defines the boundary
between diagenesis and metamorphism in sedimentary rocks as follows:
“…the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism is somewhat
arbitrary and strongly dependent on the lithologies involved. For
example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures
than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white
mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42 Delta 2 Theta
obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of
metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of
glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or
stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism
(Frey and Kisch, 1987; Bucher and Frey, 1994; Frey and Robinson,
1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 +/-
50° C in silicate rocks. Many lithologies may show no change in
mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the
onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.”

- SLTTm (2004) proposed the following criteria to distinguish
hydrothermally altered or metasomatic rock from igneous rock. "The
rock is classified as metamorphic if (1) the texture has been modified
such that it can no longer be considered igneous, (2) the bulk
composition of the rock is inconsistent with compositions that can be
derived purely from a magma and associated processes such as
assimilation and differentiation, or (3) minerals inconsistent with

- Particularly for fine-grained sedimentary rocks, distinction of
'intrabasinal' versus 'clastic' genesis can be very interpretive. In
practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to
carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge
about the rock being categorized. If it is associated with other
clastic rocks, the clastic categories will be favored, if with
cabonate rocks, the carbonate categories will be favored. Carbonate
rock subcatgories are defined on two orthogonal dimensions--mineralogy
(calcitic vs. dolomitic vs non-carbonate impurities), and texture. The
texture categories used here are those of Dunham (1962), and involve
grain size (matrix vs. grains/allochems), fabric (matrix vs. grain
supported), and genesis (bound, frame, or fragmental). The textural
approach used for carbonate rocks is conceptually incompatible with
that used for clastic sedimentary rocks, which is solely grain size or
mineralogy based. This leads to problems in the vocabulary for rocks
of mixed siliclastic/carbonate mineralogy (grainstone vs. sandstone,
carbonate mudstone vs. carbonate rich mudstone, how to accomodate
marlstone...).
- Sedimentary rock in which at least 50 percent of the primary and/or

- Sedimentary rock in which at least 50 percent of the constituent
particles were derived from erosion, weathering, or mass-wasting of
pre-existing earth materials, and transported to the place of
deposition by mechanical agents such as water, wind, ice and gravity.
- The conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, and wackestone categories are
not defined as kinds of clastic sedimentary rocks because rocks
meeting their purely grainsize based definitions might also be iron-
rich, phosphatic, or carbonate. This is based on GeoSciML allowance to
assign rocks to more than one lithology category. For example to
categorize a rock as a clastic conglomerate requires assignment ot the
'clastic sedimentary rock' category and to the 'conglomerate'
category. Particularly for fine-grained sedimentary rocks, distinction
of 'intrabasinal' versus 'clastic' genesis can be very interpretive.
In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to

that it may consist of redeposited pyroclastic material, usually based

category include siliciclastic and terrigineous clastic. Siliciclastic
is considered too limiting because the category includes rocks that
consists clasts of carbonate minerals, e.g. epiclastic detritus eroded
from carbonate rock. Terrigineous clastic was considered and rejected
first because it is considered redundant, anything that is
terrigineous is clastic. Second, it is questionable if clastic
sediment derived by submarine processes (fragementation by gravity
sliding, faulting, or volcanic activity, with transport by sediment
gravity flow or submarine currents) is terrigineous, but it is clastic
and is meant to be included in this category.
