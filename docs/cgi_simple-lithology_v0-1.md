[]{#compound_material}

##  compound material

Material, possibly including other compound Materials. This is 'top'
of lithology category hierarchy, and should be used to indicate 'any
rock or unconsolidated material'.

[]{#breccia}

###  breccia


- Child of:
 [`compound_material`](#compound_material)

- Coarse-grained material composed of angular broken rock fragments;
the fragments typically have sharp edges and unworn corners. The
fragments may be held together by a mineral cement or in a fine-
grained matrix, and consolidated or nonconsolidated. Clasts may be of
any composition or origin. In sedimentary environments, breccia is
used for material that consists entirely of angular fragments, mostly
derived from a single source rock body, as in a rock avalanche
deposit, and matrix is interpreted to be the product of comminution of
clasts during transport. Diamictite or diamicton is used when the
material reflects mixing of rock from a variety of sources, some sub
angular or subrounded clasts may be present, and matrix is pre-
existing fine grained material that is not a direct product of the
brecciation/deposition process.

- Fine-grained or porphyritic igneous rock with less than 20 percent
quartz, and less than 10 percent feldspathoid minerals, in which the
ratio of plagioclase to total feldspar is greater 0.65. Typically
composed of calcic plagioclase and clinopyroxene; phenocrysts
typically include one or more of calcic plagioclase, clinopyroxene,
orthopyroxene, and olivine. Includes rocks defined modally in QAPF
fields 9 and 10 or chemically in TAS field B as basalt. Basalt and
andesite are distinguished chemically based on silica content, with
basalt defined to contain less than 52 weight percent silica. If
chemical data are not available, the color index is used to
distinguish the categories, with basalt defined to contain greater
than 35 percent mafic minerals by volume or greater than 40 percent
mafic minerals by weight.

- Alkali olivine basalt is silica-undersaturated, characterized by the
absence of orthopyroxene, absence of quartz, presence of olivine, and
typically contains some feldspathoid mineral, alkali feldspar or
phlogopite in the groundmass. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are
labradorite to andesine in composition. Augite is rich in titanium
compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Alkali olivine basalt is
relatively rich in sodium.

#######  tholeiitic basalt


- Child of:
 [`basalt`](#basalt)

- Tholeiitic basalt is defined here to contain 2 pyroxene phases and
interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite in the groundmass.
Pyroxene (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich
plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a
phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. Only in
tholeiitic basalt is olivine in reaction relationship with melt.
Interstitial siliceous residue may be present, and is often glassy.
Tholeiitic basalt is relatively poor in sodium. This category includes
most basalts of the ocean floor, most large oceanic islands, and
continental flood basalts such as the Columbia River Plateau.

- Alkali olivine basalt is silica-undersaturated, characterized by the
absence of orthopyroxene, absence of quartz, presence of olivine, and
typically contains some feldspathoid mineral, alkali feldspar or
phlogopite in the groundmass. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are
labradorite to andesine in composition. Augite is rich in titanium
compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Alkali olivine basalt is
relatively rich in sodium.

#######  tholeiitic basalt


- Child of:
 [`basalt`](#basalt)

- Tholeiitic basalt is defined here to contain 2 pyroxene phases and
interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite in the groundmass.
Pyroxene (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich
plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a
phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. Only in
tholeiitic basalt is olivine in reaction relationship with melt.
Interstitial siliceous residue may be present, and is often glassy.
Tholeiitic basalt is relatively poor in sodium. This category includes
most basalts of the ocean floor, most large oceanic islands, and
continental flood basalts such as the Columbia River Plateau.

quartz, and less than 10 percent feldspathoid minerals, in which the
ratio of plagioclase to total feldspar is greater 0.65. Typically
composed of calcic plagioclase and clinopyroxene; phenocrysts

- Alkali olivine basalt is silica-undersaturated, characterized by the
absence of orthopyroxene, absence of quartz, presence of olivine, and
typically contains some feldspathoid mineral, alkali feldspar or
phlogopite in the groundmass. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are
labradorite to andesine in composition. Augite is rich in titanium
compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Alkali olivine basalt is
relatively rich in sodium.

- Child of:

- Tholeiitic basalt is defined here to contain 2 pyroxene phases and
interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite in the groundmass.
Pyroxene (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich
plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a
phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. Only in
tholeiitic basalt is olivine in reaction relationship with melt.
Interstitial siliceous residue may be present, and is often glassy.
Tholeiitic basalt is relatively poor in sodium. This category includes
most basalts of the ocean floor, most large oceanic islands, and
continental flood basalts such as the Columbia River Plateau.
